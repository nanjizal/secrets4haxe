Just getting some ideas down v.early stages

## Secrets 4 Haxe

Haxe is not widely known or used programming language but pragmatically it's a great tool - a wonderful secret!
As a self taught coder I will present Haxe 4 in my own way, hopefully it will complement other sources.

### What is Haxe ?

Haxe full potential is not easy to explain, so instead I will mention a few interesting aspects that interest me.

- Haxe embraces typing concepts found in functional languages but also Object orientated approaches, some of the best of both.
- Haxe provides fast and safe language, translating to runtime Javascript or C++ and more. 
- Haxe will be an improvement if you use a corporate programming language that many companies tie themselves with.
- To use basic Haxe is not hard to get started, yet provides freedoms and removes ecosystem restrictions.
- A mix and match language where you can mix use with the target language, providing pragmatic flexability.

We will in time properly cover the points above, and you can come to your own conclusions.

### Where did Haxe come from?

Imagine building a game for the web back in the day when Javascript was limited, and the only real option was plugins like Director and Flash. 
Flash needed to be fed with game data with a LAMP software stack, but French acedemia was teaching Ocaml and serious software theories. 
The web experiance was fragmented and ugly.
So rather than build a game engine like many game developers, Nicolas ended up creating a progamming Transpiler/Language.
Haxe evolved from internal work tools to replace the pain of directly using PHP/ActionScript/Javascript. 
Other developers contributed Haxe evolved with more targets like C++.

You can read more on Haxe history on the Haxe.org site.

### Haxe 4 getting started

The most basic Haxe4 'hello world' program we can write to console or terminal:

```Haxe
function main(){
   trace('hello world');
}
```
